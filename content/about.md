## Presentation

I'm starting this blog to share and keep track of my journey as a software developer... I'm a french guy who loves to discover and learn new things.

If you want to find out how I ended up becoming a developer you can read my story [here](/post/story)

## Why this blog

I was first reluctant to the idea of writing a blog because I thought there was already too many blog out there. I was also not finding the time to setup a simple blog with my own domain name. This is why I chose to build it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a simple theme : [Minimal](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/minimal/).

I also red a tweet from Catalin Pitt who was encouraging every beginner's to start a blog. Until know I mainly used Github to store some of my memos and configuration but I have to admin it's not really practical. This is why I created this blog and I'll try to write some cool things I learn and understand and summarize that here...
