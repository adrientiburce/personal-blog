## FrontEnd : React Native

Application was developed thanks to [Expo](https://expo.io).

Expo ease cross platform development with some libraries with native functionalities available with React native.
Deployment is also super easy with Expo and with one command the app can be redeployed with OTA (Over the Air) updates.



## Backend : Symfony with [Api Platform](https://api-platform.com)

A Rest API built with Api Platform exposes all the backend.
The project is unit tested thanks to Php Unit and a Travis CI triggers the full test suits automatically.
